        Thanks for downloading the app. I used it to learn
        how to use Android Studio so I hope you enjoy! If
        you like the app I would appreciate it if you could
        rate it on the play store. \n\n
        If you wish for me to add certain sounds or characters
        leave a rating with comments on what you would like to
        see! I will update it as much as possible. \n\n
        Rick and Morty was created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon
        and is the property of Adult Swim. I do not own this content
        and am not profiting from this app. \n\n

        PEACE AMONG WORLDS.</string>
